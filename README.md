# Investment-SAI: Identifying and Mitigating Biases in Equity Selection Models Using Machine Learning 

## Stock selection model using a symbolic AI approach

This case study, and the accompanying Python code lab, focuses on mitigating biases in equity selection models and develops three models:
- Traditional Quant Model. We test a traditional quant model based on linear factors, identifying problematic assumptions and violations.

- Hybrid ML/Quant Model. We seek to improve this traditional factor approach by adding ML, which entails additional risks and biases.

- Interpretable ML Model. We examine a purpose-designed ML model using the symbolic artificial intelligence (SAI) approach, developed to avoid or address many biases present in the preceding modeling approaches.

## Afterword
We have done our best to include the key themes of what we think are the critical stages of model development in this notebook, but clearly in practice many more checks and details would be added to each of the 5 model development stages to best ensure stakeholder's KPIs are met, and Governance standards would be as high as possible. Hopefully our example and key themes will provide insight to avoid many of the classic biases in model development.
