# Investment-SAI: Identifying and Mitigating Biases in Equity Selection Models Using Machine Learning 

# Stock selection model using a symbolic AI approach

This case study, and the accompanying Python code lab, focuses on mitigating biases in equity selection models and develops three models:
- Traditional Quant Model. We test a traditional quant model based on linear factors, identifying problematic assumptions and violations.

- Hybrid ML/Quant Model. We seek to improve this traditional factor approach by adding ML, which entails additional risks and biases.

- Interpretable ML Model. We examine a purpose-designed ML model using the symbolic artificial intelligence (SAI) approach, developed to avoid or address many biases present in the preceding modeling approaches.
